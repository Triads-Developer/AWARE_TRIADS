## AWARE Mobile Sensing App - Emotion and Behavior Study

The AWARE Mobile Sensing App - Emotion and Behavior Study plans to use the mobile sensing app AWARE (https://awareframework.com/) to collect data from participants next semester while using a different app to send them surveys to their phones every two hours. AWARE is an open source software that enables the project to collect data such as GPS, activity, phone use, etc. The project wants to then look at how emotion and emotion regulation are related to these passively sensed contextual features.

# Background

The project is a team of researchers studying the relationship between behavior patterns, emotion regulation, and emotion. They have previously used the AWARE app successfully in a study with 200 undergraduates, focusing on features such as location and phone use. However, they would like to optimize their use of this app for data collection to better understand the relationship between behavior patterns and emotional regulation.

# Getting Started

To participate in the study, participants will need to download the AWARE app on their smartphone. The app is available for download on Google Play Store for free, and a custom built App store AWARE app. Participants will also need to agree to receive survey prompts every two hours through a separate app.

## Data Privacy

The project takes data privacy seriously and complies with all necessary legal and ethical standards. All data collected through the AWARE app is anonymized and stored securely in a database. Participants have full control over their data and can choose to withdraw from the study at any time.

## Data Analysis

The project will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the sensor data collected from participants' smartphones. The analysis aims to identify behavior patterns such as physical activity, sleep, and social interaction, among others. The project will then analyze this data in relation to the emotion and emotion regulation data collected through surveys.
